-- Takes a directed graph and reverses every edge in it.
-- The directed graph is expected to be described as follows.
-- Each line corrisponds to one node in the graph. The line
-- begins with the name of the node followed by a space, and
-- is followed by the names of adjacent nodes, separated by
-- spaces. The output graph is in the same format.
